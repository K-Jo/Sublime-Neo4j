# Sublime Text 2 plugin: Neo4j

* Sublime is one of the best cross platform editors, so i thought why not create a simple Neo4j plugin so here it is.
* Solves the problem of running Neo4j queries from terminal and not being able to save/manage your query files in one place
* This is a very rough draft of the plugin, will add features if time permits, others are welcome to add to this project.


#Installation:
* Just make a clone of the repo into your ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/Neo4j/ or equivalent on Windows/Linux.
* Edit Neo4j.sublime-settings to point to the right API, defaulted to localhost
* Default query run key is ctrl+r , edit Default.sublime-keymap if you need to change this.
